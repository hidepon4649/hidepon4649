## Introduction

### Work
- Approximately 20 years in IT career.
- Been an IT engineer since around 2000 when the internet started becoming popular among the general public.
- Freelance web application engineer.
- Proficient in server-side Java and hold Java certification from Sun/Oracle.
- Extensive experience with RDB (logical design, SQL, SQL tuning) and hold certification from Oracle.
- As part of IT literacy, hold various national certifications (former Class 1, former Class 2, DB Specialist, Security Specialist).
- Participated as a contract engineer at a major transportation equipment manufacturer for about 10 years until 2020.
  - The technologies used were outdated, so I felt like Rip Van Winkle (sweat).
  - Currently catching up with modern frontend technologies.
    <br>My study methods are a modern dual approach: "Udemy's hands-on courses" and "pair programming with generative AI".
- Extensive experience collaborating with young engineers, actively sharing knowledge and exchanging opinions.
- Love open, proactive, and productive teams.
- Rich experience in maintaining legacy systems (debugging and adding features), though I prefer new development.
