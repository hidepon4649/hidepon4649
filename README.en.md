## About Me

### Work

- Around 20 years of experience in IT.
- I'm a freelance web application engineer.
- I've been working as an IT engineer since around the year 2000, when the internet began to gain popularity.
- I specialize in server-side Java.
- I have extensive experience with RDBs (logical design, SQL, and SQL tuning).
- From 2012 to 2021, I worked on-site as a contract engineer for a major transportation equipment manufacturer.
  - Involved in all phases: requirements definition, basic design, detailed design, implementation, operations & maintenance, QA support, and user training.
  - The technologies used were quite outdated, so I became a bit like Rip Van Winkle üòÖ.
  - Currently catching up on modern frontend technologies.  
    <br>My study approach is a modern dual-style: "Hands-on courses on Udemy" and "Pair programming with generative AI."  
    <br>I'm sharing the results in my [portfolio](https://github.com/hidepon4649/AttendanceManagement).
- I have plenty of experience collaborating with junior engineers and actively engage in knowledge sharing and discussions.

### Personal Life

- **Travel**
    - During my student days, I traveled solo as a backpacker.  
      Countries visited: UK, India, China, Hong Kong (before the handover), Thailand, Nepal.
    - After starting my career, I stopped traveling due to financial constraints and a busy schedule, but later resumed thanks to photography.
- **Photography**
